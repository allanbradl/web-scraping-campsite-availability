# web-scraping-campsite-avialability
This python program runs every 30 mins (user input) to check for the availability of campsites at a particular campground (under heavy demand) and emails the user the availability within a specific duration. It uses Python's selenium module to scrape the recreation.gov website and uses a .bat file to schedule the repeated run for the python code in windows.
